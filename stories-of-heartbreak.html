    <h1>Stories of Heartbreak</h1>
    <h2>Am I being molded or am I just plain old suffering?</h2>
    <p> Let’s start from day 0. The person you love most in the world has exited your life. 
      To me this felt like I was dying. I felt like there was no way that I was going to keep living in this world without the person I love. 
      Not only the person I love, the person who makes me laugh, who gives me hugs, who goes on adventures big and small with me. 
      How the hell are you supposed to accept that reality? How do you go on? Well, lucky for me and you, time goes on for you. 
      You don’t have to lift a finger. To give you the backstory, my ex, let's call him SSB (stands for sweet silly boy) and I dated for 9-10 months. 
      I’m not even sure actually. And yeah, I had the best times of my life with him. Unfortunately, stuff happened that I don’t understand at all (and is not worth getting into at the moment or maybe ever) which led to me and him breaking up. 
      I tried to understand it for a long time and finally had to accept it as unknowable. 
      So that’s what brought me to day 0. That’s what brought me to feeling like my throat was closing up, my stomach and chest were tight and uneasy, and tears were streaming down my face until I had a headache so bad I had to force myself to take a break.

    <h1>The Places We Went</h1>
    <p>The places we went include everywhere. We went to every location. We went to the QFC by my house. We bought a melon at Whole Foods. We walked to PCC while smoking a joint and laughed uncontrollably. Hmm, was our relationship very food based or am I just obsessed with grocery stores? No, there’s other places too. We went everywhere, remember? We went to the climbing gym and he told me he was proud to be my boyfriend. We went to the HRC and worked together. We went to Costco (oops more food). We went to the central district to help his brother move. We went to the waterfront downtown and pretended we were tourists and lightly debated Louigi Mangioni. We went to cap hill. We went to Ballard. Snoqualmie? Check. Ikea? Check. Utah? No, but that’s where SSB is from and every time it’s brought up which is weirdly a lot I get sick to my stomach. The point is we went everywhere and I have no peace. I can’t escape the heart dropping feeling of a memory. I could maybe hide in my bed but then I’d remember our wiggles and cuddles. So instead, I go to the places anyway and I bear the memories and I wonder how we went so many places and if the places will ever become neutral again.</p>
