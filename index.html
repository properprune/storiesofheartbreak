    <h1>What Do I Do With the Thoughts I Don't Want?</h1>
    <p> <p>Here are some things I feel embarrassed by:
      <br>
      <br>

        1. It has been three months since me and SSB broke up and there has not been a single day he hasn’t been on my mind for a significant portion of the day. Some days are good and he only pops up in the background or on a walk through the neighborhood. Some days are hard and he takes over my mind and I cry a lot. I feel weird that I haven’t been able to get to a point where he’s not always there even though I am doing a lot better. I feel like there should be at least some days that he doesn’t pop up. SSB gave me a book called Intrusions by Ursula Hegi right before we broke up. In the book, the story keeps getting intruded on by the author’s real life, side stories, and other characters in the book. I think of him like an intrusion. Go away SSB, you’re not wanted in my brain. You’re INTRUDING.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. I would still get back together with SSB if he asked. I still have moments when I think we’re meant to be together. I miss him terribly. I feel so silly because I’m pretty confident he has moved on and is living happily on his own. Also, I don’t think at this point getting back together is actually a good idea. But that doesn’t stop me from secretly wanting it.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. I think SSB is the hottest person in the world. His mannerisms, his face, his personality. I think he’s beautiful. I also felt very undesired towards the end of our relationship, like he didn’t really find me attractive, and that also embarrassingly makes me think about how he doesn’t think I’m the hottest person in the world. I have a fear that I won’t find anyone else I date as attractive. And I have been giving that fear a little too much space in my mind.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. I thought me and SSB would be together forever. I thought we were each other’s people. Partly because I felt so completely myself around him which is a rare feeling for me. Probably mostly because he was obsessed with me the first month we were dating and future faked quite a bit. He told me he never wanted to not have me in his life, he talked about getting a cat and an apartment together, he said I was everything he was looking for in a partner. Only to then refuse to commit to living together one day in the future some months later (sorry that was a little more accusatory than I was planning). I fully bought into this. I fell more and more in love with him and continued to imagine our adventures to come. Meanwhile, he was getting more and more unsure he even wanted to be in a relationship. So yeah, I fell for it. I really believed it and that feels silly.
        <br>
        <br>
        It feels good to get these embarrassing thoughts out in the open. I have not treated them very well. I’ve tried to shove them away, berate them, and not let them in. They always find a way in anyways no matter how hard I try to pretend they don’t exist. So, I’ve been trying a new tactic the past few days. I’m letting them be. I’m recognizing that they aren’t necessarily helpful and accurate thoughts, but they're there, and it’s totally normal that they’re there. When they arrive in my mind, I say, “I don’t love that I still think this, but it makes sense that I do”. It's okay that I do. I'm trying to let go of the shame around anything I feel and welcome the feelings in. Treat them like they're just trying to protect me. They're just doing their best.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="post-thankful" class="tab-content hidden">
    <h1>Am I Thankful For Our Relationship?</h1>
    <p>One of the cheesiest things I told SSB was that I used to have so many regrets about all of the choices I had made in my life in the past and now I don’t because I met him. And every one of those choices led me to meeting him. I was at a stoplight waiting to exit a parking lot and talking on the phone with him when I told him this. 
      I remember the glow of the green light quite clearly. After we broke up, I would cry thinking about that memory because now it felt like all my choices just led to an unbearable pain. The regret was back. And I was angry that SSB had put me through this. 
      There have been moments where I wanted the pain to end so badly that I doubted that any of it was worth it. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The anger has faded now (although still sometimes rages up) and I’ve recognized my role in things better. I still have really hard moments, tears, hopelessness, but I’m now certain that I would not trade the relationship for feeling less pain. I am thankful for it. 
      SSB recognized this immediately after we broke up. He said he doesn’t regret anything and he’s thankful he got to know me. 
      I couldn’t relate to that statement. I thought, “How could you not regret anything when it brought us to this terrible place?”. I felt like I was a worse person than him. 
      I did not want to be thankful. But I just needed more time to get there for whatever reason. And I’ve finally arrived at a place where I can talk about what I’ve gained, not just what I’ve lost. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Here are just a few things:
      <br>
      <br>
      I experienced many joyful outdoor adventures.I received a lot of help in understanding statistics. I got to feel really loved for some time which can be a rare feeling. I got to love someone else really deeply. I learned to love and like myself on a deeper level. I drank homemade kombucha. I tried backcountry skiing. I laughed really really hard. I acted silly a lot and felt completely safe. I felt at home in Seattle for the first time. I met a beautiful and accepting family who welcomed me during holidays when I didn’t fly home. I met my friend Kayla, who taught me how to knit! And after it ended, I learned how to build a life for myself that is full without a boyfriend in it.  I learned how I respond to conflict in a relationship and how I can respond better in the future. I learned that I am more capable than I used to believe. And I was reminded that I can get through unimaginably difficult feelings. So overall, it was a net positive.
</p>
  </div>

  <div id="post-not-nice" class="tab-content hidden">
    <h1>If I'm Not Nice, What Am I?</h1>
    <p>As I’ve mentioned, I didn’t always act in the most respectful way after our breakup. Everytime the anxiety became too much, I would text. I asked him to block me on every platform possible to try to save myself from embarrassment but still managed to by emailing him at his work email. I can recognize now that it’s not a good look, and to be honest I never realized the weight that work emails have in this world. Probably because I use my work email to chat with my brother and send crossword puzzles back and forth to friends. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I didn’t give him the space he needed, plain and simple. I dumped my anxiety onto him. In our last conversation (that I pretty much forced him to have with me), he seemed so tired of me. So tired of my questions, my tears, my desire to talk things through. I blamed him for everything I was going through and said some cruel things in a moment of pain. He told me that I had become a different person in the past 2 months since our break up. The realization of how he now viewed me hit me like a punch to the stomach. I had hurt him. I had hurt him and he obviously was not happy about it. He wanted nothing to do with me. How did our breakup go from us crying in each other's arms out of love to me weeping on the phone as he stoically told me goodbye and hung up? A new feeling had emerged in the breakup process: shame. A lot of it.
      <br>
      <br>
      The thought that SSB thought less of me now was devastating. I’ve always struggled with knowing I have hurt someone and this brought a whole new level of bad feelings. Of course I gave the most genuine apology I could and took accountability for my actions, but it didn’t change anything. I had already made the mistakes. I realized one of the reasons it hurt so badly is because one of the things he most admired about me was my character and my kindness to others. Now that he saw I wasn’t perfect, that I made mistakes, hurt people, and mishandled my emotions, I thought he saw nothing left in me. If I’m not nice, then what else do I have to offer to anyone? Why would he ever want to talk to me again?
      <br>
      <br>
      I spent years and years hating myself growing up. Since I believed I didn’t have anything to contribute to the world, I always made an effort to at least not contribute anything bad. Being a good person became a core part of how I saw myself and others reinforced this belief by often complimenting my good heart and kindness towards others. Now I’m at a place where I do like myself, but that part of my identity is so ingrained in me that I have a lot of trouble seeing what other adjectives might describe me. I constantly feel like a fraud when I make a mean comment about someone in my head, I say something rude, or I do something that’s just plain wrong. <em>See! I’m not the nice person everyone thinks I am! Sure, I’m fine, I’m not evil, but I’m nothing special!</em> But if they find that out, then they might not like me anymore because that’s all I have. If I’m not nice, what am I?
      <br>
      <br>
      I know I have to internalize that kindness does not mean perfection. I am a human who fucks up and I am continually trying to change in a positive way. I care about what other people think about me because, again, I’m a human and it’s very difficult to be impermeable to other people’s opinions even though that is the ultimate goal. And if someone is judging me so harshly for making a mistake that hurts them after I give a genuine, heartfelt, apology, then they are probably not someone I can be comfortable being myself around. They are probably not someone I want in my life. 
      <br>
      <br>
      This is a comforting thought as I navigate knowing SSB might see me in a more negative light. He may forgive me and not let my actions that came from heartbreak tarnish how he sees me and our relationship or he might not. I can’t control it. One thing I do know is that he has hurt me as well. He has said things out of confusion and pain and it does not tarnish how I view him one bit. I may realize we weren’t right for each other at this moment in our lives, but I still think he is a beautiful, sweet, silly, good person.

    <h1>What If He Starts Dating Someone New?</h1>
 <p>I was on a run today and I had a thought that made my stomach drop. It may be a bit weird that this is the first time the thought occurred, but I guess it had become more of a reality: SSB dating someone else. I had been having a decent day before this disturbing thought popped into my head and I was also disturbed by the impact it was having on me. I didn’t think I could handle it. The options were to do everything in my power never to find out that he is dating again or get destroyed when I do find out. Why? Why should it matter so much what this person who is no longer in my life is doing? Here are a few facts:
    <br>
    <br>
      1. SSB’s actions do not have anything to do with how I live my life now.<br>
      2. SSB’s feelings towards someone else do not have anything to do with how he felt when he was with me.<br>
      3. SSB’s feelings towards someone else do not change my value as a human.<br>
      4. It is normal and expected that people date new people after a relationship ends.<br>
      5. I am awesome. <br>
      6. I will die if SSB starts dating someone else.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sorry, I deviated from the facts a little at the end. But knowing all of those facts annoyingly doesn't help me at all. They do not take away the pain and fear. Here is what I am thinking and feeling:
    <br>
    <br>
    1. SSB dating someone else means he doesn’t love me anymore which means he never really loved me. He has to pine on me and love me forever.<br>
    2. SSB dating someone else means there was something wrong with me that made him unable to commit to me and give me the love I deserve. Someone else is more worthy of that than I was. <br>
    3. I am jealous of that person that might get what I couldn’t get from SSB. I am jealous that they would get to spend time with him and I don’t.<br>
    4. SSB dating someone else means there is no chance of us ever getting back together.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I know these are ridiculous unhelpful thoughts but hey, I’m just trying to be honest. I’m trying to figure out why I was so triggered by the idea of SSB moving on. I think it’s because it makes me feel unworthy and definitely not awesome despite that being fact #5. It tells me that despite how much work I have put into loving myself, supporting myself, being kind to myself, and knowing I am worthy of consistent love, there is still so much more work to be done. I am nowhere near impermeable to external factors affecting my self worth. In fact, they can crumble with a single thought. But at least now I know what is fact and what is not (for the most part). That’s a great start. And also, when I really think about it, SSB is probably not going to have changed that much and the next person will have to go through what I already experienced and decided was not for me. I'm not jealous of that.

 <h1>The Voice Memo That Reminds Me Why It Needed to End:</h1>
      <p>December 8, 2024
      <br>
      <br>
      “I just don’t know what to do. I don’t fucking know what to do. I don’t know what to do. God. I don’t. I don’t know. I need to die. I need to die. If I have another emergency. If I have an emergency. I don’t get to have another emergency. I don’t get to have another one.” Followed by sobbing.
      <br>
      <br>
      POV: I am having a mental health crisis but I feel unable to tell SSB despite wanting his help very badly. He has previously mentioned he couldn’t be there for every emergency ("How many emergencies would there be?"), so I had to save his help for only the worst emergencies. But how do I know what the worst will be? He needed someone who needed less support Someone more stable. And that's okay. I needed someone who wanted more. Who craved to be there for me like I crave to be there for someone else. And that's okay.

    <h1>The Voice Memo That Breaks My Heart the Most:</h1>
      <p>August 29, 2024 
      <br>
      <br>
      "I am absolutely so lucky that I met [SSB]... I think he brings my body and mind comfort and peace and acceptance. Like it’s really surreal that he likes me too, and I get to be with him… Life is scarier now, because I have such a beautiful thing to lose. I trust him. I really, really trust him."
      <br>
      <br>
      POV: The month of bliss.

    <div id="post-doing-best" class="tab-content hidden">
 <h1>Just Doing Our Best</h1>
 <p>Here’s the truth. There are people (like me) that think they need connection so badly that it gets to a point where their body feels like it’s going to explode and the anxiety gets worse and worse and worse until it feels like the only option is to reach out to your ex. Truely, it feels like that is the only way to survive in this world. I did this and if anyone got through the breakup process without doing this then I don’t think you felt the level of anxiety and despair that I felt because it truly felt like life or death (did I mention I have an anxiety disorder?).
      <br>
      <br>
      Do I feel a lot of shame? Yes. Did SSB find this disrespectful? Yes. Do I wish he could have had more understanding that my coping is very different than his? Yes. But you know what? We were both hurting and I don’t judge him for anything he did in those 2 months because all you can do is your best when going through pain. I do judge myself because I feel embarrassed. I feel embarrassed I let my anxiety and anger control my actions. But I was doing my best too. 
      <br> 
      <br>
      Sometimes your best means finding SSB’s email online to ask if I could get my card game back because I thought it would give me some closure. Instead, it angered SSB because unfortunately the email I happened to find was his work email and I had quote “crossed the line”. To be fair, no one told me where the fucking line was. But I suppose I have always felt like I had a little bit of common sense missing from me especially when mixed with anxiety. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Sometimes your best means pulling away and becoming cold when your ex wants to discuss something. But also, sometimes your best is going on a hike with your best friend and falling in love with the world again and again. Sometimes your best is feeding yourself and treating yourself with kindness. Your best does not mean perfect. It just means your best in your current mindset, your current situation, and your current knowledge of the world. Gotta have some compassion.

 <h1>The Places We Went</h1>
<p> The places we went include everywhere. We went to every location. We went to the QFC by my house. We bought a melon at Whole Foods. We walked to PCC while smoking a joint and laughed uncontrollably. Hmm, was our relationship very food based or am I just obsessed with grocery stores? No, there’s other places too. We went everywhere, remember? We went to the climbing gym and he told me he was proud to be my boyfriend. We went to the HRC and worked on homework together. We went to Costco to buy muffins for our camping trip. We went to the Central District to help his brother move. We went to the Waterfront Downtown and pretended we were tourists and lightly debated Louigi Mangioni. We went to Cap Hill. We went to Ballard. Snoqualmie? Check. Ikea? Check. Utah? No, but that’s where SSB is from and every time it’s brought up which is weirdly a lot I get sick to my stomach. The point is we went everywhere and I have no peace. I can’t escape the heart dropping feeling of a memory. I could maybe hide in my bed but then I’d remember our wiggles and cuddles. So instead, I go to the places anyway and I bear the memories and I wonder how we went so many places and if the places will ever become neutral again.
