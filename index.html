    <h1>Stories of Heartbreak</h1>
    <h2>Am I being molded or am I just plain old suffering?</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> Let’s start from day 0. The person you love most in the world has exited your life. 
      To me this felt like I was dying. I felt like there was no way that I was going to keep living in this world without the person I love. 
      Not only the person I love, the person who makes me laugh, who gives me hugs, who goes on adventures big and small with me. 
      How the hell are you supposed to accept that reality? How do you go on? Well, lucky for me and you, time goes on for you. 
      You don’t have to lift a finger. 
      <br>
      <br>
      To give you the backstory, my ex, let's call him SSB (stands for sweet silly boy because he is all three of those things) and I dated for 9-10 months. 
      I’m not even sure actually. And yeah, I had the best times of my life with him. Unfortunately, stuff happened that I don’t understand at all (and is not worth getting into at the moment or maybe ever) which led to me and him breaking up. 
      I tried to understand it for a bit and finally had to accept it unknowable for now. 
      So that’s what brought me to day 0. That’s what brought me to feeling like my throat was closing up, my stomach and chest were tight and uneasy, and tears were streaming down my face until I had a headache so bad I had to force myself to take a break.
      <br>
      <br>
      To be clear, everything I'm writing is extremally biased and come from feeling, not fact. If I were to write, "he never loved me", this is how it felt to me at the time, but is very likely not factually correct. So when some of my thoughts seem unfair or problematic, they probably are. I'm writing from a place of confusion and hurt and one perspective in a situation that involves multiple people.

    <h1>The Places We Went</h1>
    <p style="line-height: 1.5;"> The places we went include everywhere. We went to every location. We went to the QFC by my house. We bought a melon at Whole Foods. We walked to PCC while smoking a joint and laughed uncontrollably. Hmm, was our relationship very food based or am I just obsessed with grocery stores? No, there’s other places too. We went everywhere, remember? We went to the climbing gym and he told me he was proud to be my boyfriend. We went to the HRC and worked on homework together. We went to Costco to buy muffins for our camping trip. We went to the Central District to help his brother move. We went to the Waterfront Downtown and pretended we were tourists and lightly debated Louigi Mangioni. We went to Cap Hill. We went to Ballard. Snoqualmie? Check. Ikea? Check. Utah? No, but that’s where SSB is from and every time it’s brought up which is weirdly a lot I get sick to my stomach. The point is we went everywhere and I have no peace. I can’t escape the heart dropping feeling of a memory. I could maybe hide in my bed but then I’d remember our wiggles and cuddles. So instead, I go to the places anyway and I bear the memories and I wonder how we went so many places and if the places will ever become neutral again.</p>
    <h1>Just Doing Our Best</h1>
    <p>Here’s the truth. There are people (like me) that think they need connection so badly that it gets to a point where their body feels like it’s going to explode and the anxiety gets worse and worse and worse until it feels like the only option is to reach out to your ex. Truely, it feels like that is the only way to survive in this world. I did this and if anyone got through the breakup process without doing this then I don’t think you felt the level of anxiety and despair that I felt because it truly felt like life or death (did I mention I have an anxiety disorder?).
      <br>
      <br>
      Do I feel a lot of shame? Yes. Did SSB find this disrespectful? Yes. Do I wish he could have had more understanding that my coping is very different than his? Yes. But you know what? We were both hurting and I don’t judge him for anything he did in those 2 months because all you can do is your best when going through pain. I do judge myself because I feel embarrassed. I feel embarrassed I let my anxiety and anger control my actions. But I was doing my best too. 
      <br> 
      <br>
      Sometimes your best means finding SSB’s email online to ask if I could get my card game back because I thought it would give me some closure. Instead, it angered SSB because unfortunately the email I happened to find was his work email and I had quote “crossed the line”. To be fair, no one told me where the fucking line was. But I suppose I have always felt like I had a little bit of common sense missing from me especially when mixed with anxiety. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Sometimes your best means pulling away and becoming cold when your ex wants to discuss something. But also, sometimes your best is going on a hike with your best friend and falling in love with the world again and again. Sometimes your best is feeding yourself and treating yourself with kindness. Your best does not mean perfect. It just means your best in your current mindset, your current situation, and your current knowledge of the world. Gotta have some compassion.
